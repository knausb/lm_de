# lm_de

Using the linear model to test differential expression in R

* 01_lm_de.Rmd - Basics of teh linear model in R
* 02_nb_glm.Rmd - The negative binomial generalized linear model
* 03_strain.Rmd - Modelling differences among strains
* 04_batch.Rmd - Handling batch effect
* 05_DESeq2.Rmd - Using DESeq2 on RNA Seq data

These are some rough notes and code I put together for a presentation.
