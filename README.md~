# lm_de

Using the linear model to test differential expression in R

* 01_lm_de.Rmd - Basics of the linear model in R
* 02_nb_glm.Rmd - The negative binomial generalized linear model
* 03_strain.Rmd - Modelling differences among strains
* 04_batch.Rmd - Handling batch effect
* 05_DESeq2.Rmd - Using DESeq2 on RNA Seq data

These are some rough notes and code I put together for a presentation.
More information can be found in the [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) documentation and the [RNASeq workflow](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/workflows/rnaseqGene/).
I believe much of this can be accomplished in [NBPSeq](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NBPSeq/NBPSeq.pdf) as well.
